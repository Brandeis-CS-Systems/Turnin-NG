1.0~rc2 2009-08-24
 Global:
  * Rename turninng.sys to turninng.fileperms to avoid name clashes with
    Python's sys.

 turnin:
  * Elaborate the -v option in --help to avoid confusion

 project:
  * Project without any options calls --help
  * --list for projects works.
  * Archiving a course sets it 0600 and is owned by the course's user and group.
  * Added a workaround for python2.4 since its tar.tarfile doesn't have an
    extractall()

1.0~beta2 2009-08-04
 Global:
  * Get rid of 'No `START-INFO-DIR-ENTRY' and no `This file documents' when
    installing the info file.
  * If users don't pass any arguments, print --help message
  * Add --prefix note to the INSTALL file so sysadmins don't have to search
    online for how to install under /usr/local/
  * Install man pages in the right directories.
  * Project submission directory is 733 now, it would be too much of a hassle
    sysadmins to create a group per course and add students to a group per
    course. Drop group checking.
  * Split the configurations into a global config file (used by students and
    administrators) and a course config file (used by professors and TAs).
  * [BUG FIX]: When listing projects, check for a 'default' project. This avoids
    KeyErrors.
  * Rename config files to turnin-ng.cf
  * Add option to print warranty information, as suggested by GPL
  * Set the default configuration file in /etc/turnin-ng.cf
  * Rename the turnin package to turninng
 
 turnin:
  * Use random 16 character suffixes (username-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.tar.gz) when
    submitting to prevent users from copying each other or overwriting each
    other's assignments.
  * Store these suffixes in $HOME/.turnin-ng/submissions and use UUIDs to
    identify each project. This is to prevent a course having the project A,
    removing it, and then recreating it. 
  * Have the user specify a project if the course doesn't have a default one.
 
 project:
  * Don't abort creating the course if the directory already exists.
  * [BUG FIX]: When run without args, we should not create a course and write to
    config file.
  * Initialize a project if we pass only a project name
  * Add turnin's list projects option.
  * When we compress projects, print the path to the tarball.
  * Add an option to compress a whole course directory.
  * Add an option to strip the random suffixes (-D / --perm-disable).
  * [BUG FIX]: Check that a project exists in a course before
    enabling/disabling/etc'ing it.
  * Professors can no longer switch between courses. Leave the 'default' option
    in the per course config so that TAs/professors don't have to specify the -c
    course option.
  * [BUG FIX]: Check that a course exists before archiving, creating or deleting
    it.
  * [BUG FIX]: Print project name instead of %s when disabling a project.
  * [BUG FIX]: Reset course directory to 755 when creating it instead of 733.

 Documentation:
  * Updated with all the above changes
  * [BUG FIX]: Info page now properly displays VERSION & UPDATED values.
  * Added this changelog

1.0~beta1 First release tested on a Queens server.
 Global:
  * Dropped course 'section' in the configuration files

 turnin:
  * Add option to sign submissions with GPG
  * Display project list in a table
  * No longer needs to be run setuid

 project:
  * Add option to verify GPG signatures
  * [BUG FIX]: Use path to course directory instead of project when creating
    courses
  * [BUG FIX]: Set the project directory as drwx------ after disabling so that
    students can't manually submit assignments after it's disabled.

 Documentation:
  * Added an INSTALL file
  * Added a Texinfo document
  * Fixed manpage header so that lexgrog / apropos work

0.1~beta1 First release, following the release early and release often idea
