Description: Assignment submitter and manager
 Turnin-NG is an assignment submission suite written in Python and composed of
 turnin and turnincfg. Students can use the turnin command to submit an
 assignment to a course. Professors and TAs (teaching assistants) can use
 turnincfg to manage submitted assignments, making them easier to grade.
